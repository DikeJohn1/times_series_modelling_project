# times_series_modelling_project
A time series comparative modelling of SARIMA, LSTM and Hybrid SARIMA-LSTM 

# 📈 Time Series Forecasting Project

## 🧠 Overview
This project focuses on time series analysis and forecasting using Nigeria crude oil historical data. It demonstrates techniques for preprocessing, visualization, model selection, and performance evaluation to generate accurate predictions.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Statsmodels (ARIMA, SARIMA)
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset

## 🔍 Key Steps
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Stationarity testing and differencing
- Model selection using AIC/BIC
- Forecasting and residual diagnostics

## 📈 Results

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open and run `time_series_forecasting.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook

## 📸 Sample Visuals
Include plots such as:
- Time series decomposition
- ACF/PACF plots
- Forecast vs. actual comparison
